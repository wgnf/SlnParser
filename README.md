üõ†Ô∏è .NET: Easy (to use) Parser for your .NET Solution (.sln) Files. This project targets `netstandard2.0` so it can basically be used anywhere you want. I've not yet run any performance tests.

## üíª Usage

### Parsing

```cs

var parser = new SolutionParser();
var parsedSolution = parser.Parse("path/to/your/solution.sln");

```

### Accessing the projects

```cs

// gives you a flat list of all the Projects/Solution-Folders in your Solution
var flat = parsedSolution.AllProjects;

// gives you a structured (Solution-Folders containing projects) of all the Projects/Solution-Folders in your solution
var structured = parsedSolution.Projects;

// this'll give you all the projects that are not a Solution-Folder
var noFolders = parsedSolution
  .AllProjects
  .OfType<SolutionProject>();

// this'll give you all the projects of the desired type (C# class libs in this case)
var csharpProjects = parsedSolution
  .AllProjects
  .Where(project => project.Type == ProjectType.CSharpClassLibrary);

```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Developing

To develop and work with SlnParser you just need to clone this Repo somewhere on your PC and then open the Solution or the complete Source-Folder (under `src`) with your favorite IDE. No additional tools required.  
  
Before you can start, you should restore all NuGet-Packages using `dotnet restore` if that's not done for you by your IDE.
